# Welcome to the EDI Organzation
This meta-repository helps with navigation of the repositories under "EDIorg", belonging to
the Environmental Data Initiative 
([https://environmentaldatainitiative.org](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/)).
EDI is an NSF-funded project that accellerates curation and archive environmental data, 
emphasizing data from projects funded by the NSF DEB. Programs served 
include, but are not limited to, Long Term Research in Environmental Biology 
[([LTREB](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?ProgEleCode=1196&BooleanElement=Any&BooleanRef=Any&ActiveAwards=true)), 
Organization for Biological Field Stations ([OBFS](https://obfs.org)), MacroSystems Biology 
([MSB](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?ProgEleCode=7959&BooleanElement=Any&BooleanRef=Any&ActiveAwards=true)), 
and the Long Term Ecological Research Network ([LTER](https://lternet.edu)).
